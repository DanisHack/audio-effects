### Playing Wavefile

Signifigance of wavefile properties 

```python
# Read the wave file properties
num_channels = wf.getnchannels()       	# Number of channels
Fs = wf.getframerate()                  # Sampling rate (frames/second)
signal_length  = wf.getnframes()       	# Signal length
width = wf.getsampwidth()       		# Number of bytes per sample
```
