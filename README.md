# Audio-Effects

Multiple types of audio effects will be described and implemented in python.

==
### GETTING STARTED
==

All of these implementations will be in python and therefore will utilize the pyaudio module.
I would suggest to use python 2.7 since some of the other modules I will be using will not be compatible with the 3+ version.
By default, ``pip`` and ``setuptools`` will already be installed however they will need to be upgraded:
For windows:
``python -m pip install -U pip setuptools``

For Linux or OSX:
``pip install -U pip setuptools``

Now, in order to install the pyaudio module simply type the following into the terminal:

``pip install pyaudio``
